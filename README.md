# cyclistic_case_study

This case study is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. 

In this project, I am assuming the role of a Junior Data Analyst working in the marketing team at a fictional bike-sharing company called Cyclistic. I am going to perform analysis on historical bicycle trip data in order to identify trends that would help design the companyâ€™s marketing strategies, aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

I used RStudio Desktop for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
