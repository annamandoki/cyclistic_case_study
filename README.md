# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

This case study is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. 

## Business Objective

The goal of the project was to help design marketing strategies for a fictional bike-sharing company called *Cyclistic*, aimed at converting casual riders into annual members to increase future profitability.

## Method

I performed analysis on historical bicycle trip data provided by the company, following the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.

## Deliverables

1. Statement of the business task
2. Description of the data sources including details on credibility and bias
3. Documentation of data cleaning and transformation
4. Summary of the analysis and key takeaways
5. Supporting visualizations
6. Top 3 recommendations for the company based on the analysis

## Tools

* RStudio Desktop: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
* Tableau Public: data visualizations
